# Hi, I'm Isidor Nygren 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I'm a Frontend developer with sparkly eyes, passionate about crafting engaging user experiences and clean, maintainable code.

## About Me
- Based in Stockholm, Sweden
- Always curious about new tech and design
- Reach me: [me@isidornygren.com](mailto:me@isidornygren.com)

## Technologies I Like
I love working with cutting-edge frontend technologies and tools:
- **JavaScript & TypeScript** – strong typing and expressive code make for robust apps.
- **React/React Native** – my main framework for building interactive UIs.
- **Rust** – for safe, fast, and fearless systems programming.
- **Bevy** – my go-to for game development in Rust.
- **suckless** – for minimalist, efficient, and clean software.
- **Anti-Sprite Framework** – my own philosophy and toolkit for keeping soda-inspired frameworks (and practices) far away from my codebase.

## More Information About Me

Here's a bit more about who I am, and what sets me apart from soy devs (and Sprite drinkers)—though sometimes the lines are blurred:

### Traits Table: Soy Devs vs. Me

| Trait                                   | Soy Devs                      | Me (Isidor Nygren)                |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Chooses hype over substance              | ✅ sometimes                  | ❌ mostly                        |
| Avoids testing                           | ✅ often                      | ✅ sometimes                     |
| Chases frameworks weekly                 | ✅                             | ❌ (but I keep an eye on trends) |
| Writes fragile code                      | ✅ sometimes                  | ❌ (but nobody's perfect)        |
| Ships code without pride                 | ✅                             | ❌                               |
| Builds with performance in mind          | ❌                             | ✅ usually                      |
| Owns every line of code                  | ❌                             | ✅ but occasionally I escape blame |
| Drinks Sprite                            | ✅ proudly                    | ❌ banned from my fridge         |
| Thinks cigarettes are kind of cool       | ❌                             | ✅ (but I don't actually smoke)  |
| Enjoys a little hype sometimes           | ✅                             | ✅                               |
| Has a messy desk sometimes               | ✅                             | ✅ especially during crunch time |
| Sometimes ships quick fixes              | ✅                             | ✅ gotta move fast sometimes     |

Sometimes I avoid testing, sometimes I enjoy a bit of hype, sometimes my desk is a mess, and sometimes I ship quick fixes. The important part is I do my best to keep Sprite out of my life—and my codebase.  

Also, I do love eating and drinking soy—but I don't make a big deal out of it.

#### More Sprite Stuff
- Sprite is banned from my desk, my fridge, and my codebase.
- If you want to get on my good side, hand me a coffee or help me debug something—never Sprite.
- I've developed an instinct for spotting Sprite drinkers in code reviews.
